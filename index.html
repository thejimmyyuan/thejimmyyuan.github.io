					<h2>About</h2>
					Hello, my name is Jimmy Yuan. I'm a student from New York City currently attending Stony Brook University.
					I am majoring in Information Systems and minoring in Business. Though this site is complete,
					it can go through some design and UI changes(specifically color therapy) which I will update periodically.

					<h2>Professional</h2>
					<p>
						Professionally, I've worked at multiple places throughout the summers of High School and College.
					</p>
					
					<h3>MasterCard WorldWide - Summer 2014</h3>
					<p>
						At MasterCard, I was assigned to re-create the original Publications website which was outdated. I implemented a string of new features including favoriting, sorting, filtering, and search using only JavaScript and XML. I also re-designed the layout of the site using User Experience principles. The new website is also a lot more automated than the old one, updating the site now only requires a file transfer, compared to tediously copying and pasting links in the past.

						The website is now on it's way to production.
					</p>

					<h3>TLT Consultant Stony Brook University - Fall 2013/Present</h3>
					<p>
						An on-campus job, where I, a TLT consultant will watch over various SINC sites(computer labs). Besides watching over these labs, I assisted students if they had any issues regarding software on those computers.
					</p>

					<h3>Bloomberg LP - Summer 2013</h3>
					<p>
						I was lucky enough to Intern at the prestigious Bloomberg LP. I was an intern for the Technical Operations Department, specifically the Installation's departmart. At the Installations department, I contacted various clients and assisted them in installing the Bloomberg Terminal. In addition I also helped customers with biometric devices like the B-Unit and Bloomberg Keyboard. I was also able to shadow many other departments at Bloomberg LP, allowing me to have a look at other deparments and what they do.
					</p>

					<h3>Teacher's Assistant for Web Design(CSE/ISE 102) - Spring 2012/Fall 2014</h3>
					<p>
						Graduating from Brooklyn Technical High School, I already had knowledge on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. Because of this, I was able to be a teacher's assistant for that class as a <strong>second semester freshman</strong>. There I helped students with key concepts in web design. I also had my own office hours where I would assist students with homework or classwork.
					</p>

					<h3>New York State Department of Motor Vehicles - Summer 2012</h3>
					<p>
						At the NYS DMV, I was motor vehicle representative. I did a variety of tasks including helping distribute forms regarding permits, licenses, and registrations. I also answered any questions regarding any questions relating to permits, licenses, and registrations. In addition in just handing out forms and answering questions, I also administered tests for permits and special vehicles. Throughout my time there, I served about 200-300 people a day.
