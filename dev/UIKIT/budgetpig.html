                    <p class = "uk-text-large">Budget Pig was a app made during the MasterCard Hackathon from 11/7/2015 - 11/8/2015. Collaborating with 3 other members we wanted to create an app that not only
                            managed your money; but one that also gave you suggestions on places that was in your price range. If the place you chose was out of your price range a warning would pop up.

                            We used the MasterCard Places API and Yelp API to grab the resturants. A feature that was
                            in development was the ability to purchase your goods using Simplify Commerce on the website.
