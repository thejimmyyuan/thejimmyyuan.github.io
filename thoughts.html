					<h2>Thoughts</h2>
					<h3>College</h3>
					<p>
						The life of a college student today is quite bleak, especially when tuition is on rise and student debt is almost unavoidable. Atop of this, the system we have just isn’t good enough to teach the students of today. So if you’re here and you’re already graduated and you want to know how college is now, here it is, a completely unfiltered opinion of college.
					</p>
					<p>
						First things first, the different in culture has change student interactions, though I’d say this is still the best part of college, it’s not really the same anymore. Because I’m not an extrovert, I can’t tell you exactly how everything changed. But I can definitely say smartphones, texting, and social media has become a huge part of college. Though something I’ve noticed is my generation as many others have slowly abandoned Facebook and adopted more graphic orientated social media like Instagram or Snapchat. Thing’s like Buzzfeed is on rise, basically anything with fewer words…
					</p>
					<p>
						Second is just the quality of education, college is seen as a stepping stone getting a real life job. In majors like Information Systems or even Computer Science, there’s a good chance we’ll get first hand experience in corporate America. Yet the professors teaching us have no corporate experience. It’s amazing how I can sit there and listen to how wrong they are and they don’t even know it. And even if some professors have corporate knowledge, they’re basing todays company cultures to the ones from Dilbert, culture is changing and they just cant keep up. It’s no secret college doesn’t prepare the student for a real job, but maybe it should, yet no one wants to step up to change it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Following quality of education, let’s actually talk about teaching in a class. I’ve had a fair share of professors who literally teach from the book. I didn’t pay my tuition to listen to you reading a book to me. I can have my mom read me the book for a bedtime story and basically accomplish the exact same feat for free. The point of being a lecturer and a professor is to be able to create your own lesson and style of teaching. Those professors who have their own style and not off a book are often rated the highest and most liked. Maybe it’s a sign? This is literally your job as a professor, please do it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Then there’s the lecturing… What even? Maybe in the 1700s the nobles had time to sit around and listen to you talk about something we could google. Let’s be real, it’s 2014 and we most of the student’s don’t have the attention span to listen to you talk for an hour and a half. I’ve seen people take their phones out during a one on one conversation, if you’re going to lecture for an hour and a half, you can count on us to have our phones out. And oh yeah, we’ll still do well in the class because we’ll google our way out.
					</p>
					<p>
						Assignments are also getting worse and worse because of the introduction of technology. Surprising right? Well now a lot of classes now require e-textbooks and an access key to online homework system. What so bad about an online homework system? The fact that it doesn’t matter whether you get a used, new, or no textbook you have to spend $100 to get a stupid code to do your homework. You’re literally paying $100 for a class you already paid with your tuition.
					</p>
					<p>
						But it gets better! Companies like Wiley and Pearson are a huge provider of these online textbook and lessons. Everything is planned out like it was an online course, then what the hell do I need a professor for? Because they have no idea how the system works and they even openly admit it. I can’t blame the professors either, the system Wiley and Pearson released are the most unintuitive pieces of shit I have ever seen. I know computer science students in my school that can literally poop a better product than they’re selling for $100.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is college in 2014, life is hard as a student, but we will prevail. We always do.
