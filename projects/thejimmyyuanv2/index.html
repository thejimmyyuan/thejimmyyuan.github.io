				Hello, my name is Jimmy Yuan. I'm a student from New York City currently attending Stony Brook University.

					Professionally, I've worked at multiple places throughout the summers of High School and College.
				</p>
				<br />
				<h3>MasterCard WorldWide</h3>
				<p>
					At MasterCard, I was assigned to re-create the original Publications website which was outdated. I implemented a string of new features including sorting, filtering, and search using only JavaScript and XML. I also re-designed the layout of the site using User Experience principles. The new website is also a lot more automated than the old one, updating the site now only requires a file transfer, compared to tediously copying and pasting links in the past.

					The website is now on it's way to production.
				</p>

				<h3>TLT Consultant Stony Brook University</h3>
				<p>
					An on-campus job, where I, a TLT consultant will watch over various SINC sites(computer labs). Besides watching over these labs, I assisted students if they had any issues regarding software on those computers.
				</p>

				<h3>Bloomberg LP</h3>
				<p>
					I was lucky enough to Intern at the prestigious Bloomberg LP. I was an intern for the Technical Operations Department, specifically the Installation's departmart. At the Installations department, I contacted various clients and assisted them in installing the Bloomberg Terminal. In addition I also helped customers with biometric devices like the B-Unit and Bloomberg Keyboard. I was also able to shadow many other departments at Bloomberg LP, allowing me to have a look at other deparments and what they do.
				</p>

				<h3>Stony Brook Teacher's Assistant for Web Design(CSE/ISE 102)</h3>
				<p>
					Graduating from Brooklyn Technical High School, I already had knowledge on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. Because of this, I was able to be a teacher's assistant for that class as a <strong>second semester freshman</strong>. There I helped students with key concepts in web design. I also had my own office hours where I would assist students with homework or classwork.
				</p>

				<h3>New York State Department of Motor Vehicles</h3>
				<p>
					At the NYS DMV, I was motor vehicle representative. I did a variety of tasks including helping distribute forms regarding permits, licenses, and registrations. I also answered any questions regarding any questions relating to permits, licenses, and registrations. In addition in just handing out forms and answering questions, I also administered tests for permits and special vehicles. Throughout my time there, I served about 200-300 people a day.
