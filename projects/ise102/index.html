					Have you ever looked at a really well done website and wonder, "why is this site so good?" or "wow, it's beautiful, how can you possibly do something like that?". Well it has to start somewhere. And that is design. It's often overlooked, but it's important. Just how important is design? Look at these sites and tell me which one you're more likely to stay on <a href = "http://yvettesbridalformal.p1r8.net/">Yvettes Bridal</a>	or <a href = "https://medium.com/">Medium</a>. The answer is medium, and that is because it just looks nice and you're able to read it!

					However, this design AKA User Experience extends beyond just websites, but applications as well. In our day and age, if we see something that looks ugly or complicated, we simply wont use it. So when you design apps in the future, you would want that to be physically appealing too. Website/Apps are like food, it might taste good, but some people just wont eat it unless it looks pretty.

					The design principles are easy. Just make the darn site look nice, but keep it simple, and be the user and see what you want to see and what you dont.

					<h2>Some basic ideas to hold on to</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Have some white space</li>
						<li>Choose matching colors</li>
						<li>Font and font weight is actually very important</li>
						<li>Basic effects go a long way</li>
						<li>Is it simple?</li>
						<li>Avoid aligning things pixel by pixel</li>
						<li>Use percentages</li>
						<li>Use electronic measures (em)</li>
						<li>Learn how to Mimic</li>
						<li>Ask for feedback</li>
						
					</ul>

						<h2>Trends</h2>
						Because people are noticing that design and user experience is actually a very big thing in design, trends seem to appear. Modern Trends
