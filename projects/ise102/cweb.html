					<h2>Things to note in a corporate environment</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>If you need help, don't be afraid to ask</li>
						<li>Ask for second and even third opinions</li>
						<li>Most of the time, they will never have the IDE you want</li>
						<li>Dreamweaver is always a safe bet</li>
						<li>Make sure what your manager wants</li>
						<li>Make your code easy to read</li>
						<li>Related to the previous point, indent properly</li>
						<li>Cross compatibility matters</li>
					</ul>
