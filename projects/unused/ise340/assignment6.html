Assignment 6:

<p>Premise: The objective of the game is to guess all the players and their answers! If you get guessed, you lose your turn for the round. After around 10 rounds we tally up who guessed the most correct and they win! Of course there are strategies like writing your answers like how someone else would.
</p>

<p>Paper and Pens are used as physical objects. You need to write the answers down to read the answers. 
</p>

<p>Relationships between objects: The papers contain an answer that each person who played the game wrote, and the goal once again is to guess out WHO wrote the answer.
</p>
<p>The information structure is mixed because, you know all the answers but you just don’t know WHO wrote the answer. 
</p>
<p>
Cybernetic Feedback Loop: This game exhibits a positive feedback loop, because the more you guess, the easier it is to guess the remaining people. However it’s noted that you should keep your guess streak because if you don’t, then the next person will gain all that advantage that you just earned.
